# Real-time-streaming-sentiment-analysis
I used this data set for training my ML model for sentiment [Sentiment dataset with 1.6 million tweets-kaggle]
(https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140), and also made all text prepossessing on it, then stream the data by spark and then make the prepossessing pip line on streamed data and make a modeling by LinearSVC which is get `83% acuracy` and deploy it by streamlit library.
